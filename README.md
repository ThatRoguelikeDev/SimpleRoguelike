The Simple Roguelike Creator(SRC)
===============

A simple roguelike base to work as a foundation for a future project of mine, will be open source and include an editor to edit the game files to customize almost everything in the game.

To run the game, download the zip file, unzip and run main.py(Must have python installed on your computer).
